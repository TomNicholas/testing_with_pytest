# testing_with_pytest
Notes and example repo for short intro talk on pytest and unit testing

The `unit_testing.ipynb` notebook contains the notes (slides if you have Jupyter RISE) for a short talk on testing for beginners.

`analysis/` contains an example repo, with simple "analysis" functions, which are tested using the tests in `analysis/tests/`. There are examples of grouping tests into a class, and using pytest fixtures.
